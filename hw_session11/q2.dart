/*Model shapes to compute total paintable area and cost.
Requirements:
- Provide a general shape type (concrete class) with an area() method that can be overridden.
- Implement at least three concrete shape types with encapsulated dimensions and validated
constructors (invalid â†’ print; keep previous).
- Use polymorphism with a mixed collection of shapes to compute total area (no type checks in client
code).
- Apply tiered pricing: first 50 units at 1.50, next 100 at 1.25, remainder at 1.00; print total area and total
cost to 2 decimals.*/

  double area() => 0.0;
