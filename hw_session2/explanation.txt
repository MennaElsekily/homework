Q1:
main()
 is the entry point of the project and the execution start from the first line in it

Q2:
var is a keyword not datatype
it holds the type of the variable store inside it at compile time
 and can't change later
dynamic is a datatype that store any type of variable inside
 and can be change later 
so we can say dynamic x=5;
then x="ahmed";
but we cant say var x=5;
then x="ahmed";
